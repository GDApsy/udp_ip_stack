QUICK START
The quick start guide can be used with the ML605 board

QUICK START with PLANAHEAD:
1) Create a new PlanAhead EMPTY project and close it
2) Do not add anything before step 3
3) Copy the content of srcs in a new folder named PROJECTNAME.srcs in the PlanAhead
   project root (Copy the PROJECTNAME from the existing PROJECNAME.data folder)
4) From srcs/constrs_1/imports/ remove the files that do not match your board
5) From srcs/sources_1/ip/ remove the folders that do not match your board
6) From srcs/sources_1/imports/udp_ip_stack/ remove the folders that do not match your board
7) Copy the content of data to the corresponding folder in the PlanAhead project root
8) Remove all the files that do not match your board from the data subfolders
9) Remove the board suffix to all the files in the data subfolders (resulting name must be fileset.xml, overwrite the existing files)
10) Import the udp.vhd top module
11) Edit the udp.vhd template module to match your needs (it can be used as a top module or as a component of another top module)

10a) Import the udp_benchmark.vhd top module
11a) Use the included Qt software to test the board ethernet speed

QUICK START GENERIC:
1) From srcs/constrs_1/imports/ remove the files that do not match your board
2) From srcs/sources_1/ip/ remove the folders that do not match your board
3) From srcs/sources_1/imports/udp_ip_stack/ remove the folders that do not match your board 
4) Import all the files in srcs to a new project
5) Import the udp.vhd top module
6) Edit the udp.vhd template module to match your needs (it can be used as a top module or as a component of another top module)

5a) Import the udp_benchmark.vhd top module
6a) Use the included Qt software to test the board ethernet speed


##################

The UDP/IP stack can work on different Xilinx board, but for each board an appropriate Ethernet mac layer must be generated.
For the ML605 and for the Virtex5$$$ the ethernet MAC layer is provided in this project, so you just need to add it to your project
(you may want to regenerate it if a newer version of the MAC has been released). 

HOWTO:
1) Generate the newest version of the Embedded Tri-Mode Ethernet MAC Wrapper IPcore for the desired board
   e.g. for the ML605 board the last available is the 2.3 version (with AXI interface).
2) Customize the IPcore as follow:   
     PHY interface: GMII
     Speed 1000Mbps
     Management Interface: Disabled
     Address filter: Disabled
     Statistic Counters: Disabled
   Note:
     -10/100/1000 speed may work as well, but I've never tried, probably some new signal to choose the speed
      must be appropriately drived
     -1000Mbps speed require all the devices in the network to support this speed, otherwise will be
      impossible to communicate to the FPGA. So only Gigabit routers are allowed!
3) Generate the output products of the Ipcore (I'm referring to PlanAhead).
4) You should manually add to the project the following files located in
   PROJECTNAME.srcs/sources_1/ip/v6_emac_v2_3_0/v6_emac_v2_3_0/example_design/
   (here I'm referring to the Virtex 6 Ethernet MAC, but should be similar for other platform).
   
   -clk_wiz.vhd
   -v6_emac_v2_3_0_block.vhd
   -v6_emac_v2_3_0_fifo_block.vhd
   -common/reset_sync.vhd
   -common/sync_block.vhd
   -fifo/rx_client_fifo_8.vhd
   -fifo/ten_100_1g_eth_fifo.vhd
   -fifo/tx_client_fifo_8.vhd
   -physical/gmii_if.vhd

5) In the same folder there is the file
   
   -v6_emac_v2_3_0_example_design.vhd
   
   Replace the "_example_design" suffix from the file name and from all the strings in it with the suffix "_wrapper".
   Using a diff tool like meld compare it to the "v6_emac_v2_3_0_wrapper.vhd" file provided with this project
   and edit it in order to add/remove the part which differs.
   In particular the interface must match the one of the template file "v6_emac_v2_3_0_wrapper.vhd" or
   it won't match the UDP_Complete.vhd component declaration.
   Add it to the project.
6) Add the content of v6_emac_v2_3_0_example_design.ucf to the master ucf file, not everything is needed (such as display, or push buttons).
